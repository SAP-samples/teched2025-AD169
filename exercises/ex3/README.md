## Exercise 3: Copy the Project ‘WarehouseOperationsManagement’ 

## 💡 Pre-Delivered Joule Skills

Since the hands-on session has limited time, we have already prepared a few **Joule Skills** for you as part of the **Warehouse Agent** setup.  
These pre-delivered skills use the **same SAP Build Action project**, allowing you to focus on exploring how Joule integrates with backend processes rather than building everything from scratch.


Here’s what the two existing skills do:

- 🧳 **Check Workload Situation**  
  This skill retrieves an overview of the **current workload** across different **activity areas** in the warehouse.  
  It helps supervisors understand where workload imbalances exist — for example, identifying areas that are over- or under-utilized — so they can make better staffing decisions.

- 🕵🏻‍♀️ **Assign Single Resource to Activity Area**  
  This skill allows supervisors to **assign an individual worker (resource)** to a specific **activity area** based on the current workload data.  
  It streamlines the manual assignment process and ensures that resources are distributed efficiently to meet operational needs.

And here’s a quick reminder of how your **final Joule Agent** will look once all the skills are connected:

## 🧩 Copy the Project ‘WarehouseOperationsManagement’ 


### Step 1: Save *WarehouseOperationsManagement* as a New Project

As mentioned earlier, some of the **Joule Skills** were pre-created for this hands-on session.  
You’ll begin by **copying the existing project** so that you can safely add a new Joule Skill within the same setup.

Follow these steps:

1. In **SAP Build Lobby**, in the project list, locate the WarehouseOperationsManagement project.
2. Click on the arrow icon (›) on the right side of the row to open the project details page.

3. On the right-side panel, open the **Versions** tab.  
4. Click the **three dots (⋮)** next to *Editable* and then click the **Save As New** button to create your personal copy.

### Step 2:  Provide Unique Name with your 

A unique name is required since there are many workshop attendees, and you need to be able to easily locate your own project.

1. Provide the name of the new project as: ```WarehouseOperationsManagement_<userid>``` 
2. Click on ‘Save’ button to save your personal version .

### Step 3: Review the Project

Once the project is saved, open it by clicking on its name in the SAP Build Lobby.  
You should now see two **pre-created Joule Skills** that are already part of this project:

- `AssignSingleResourceToActivityArea`  
- `CheckingPickingWorkloadSituation`

## 🌟 What's Next

Now that your Joule Studio project is set up, it’s time to **create your first Joule Skill**.  
This new skill will extend the existing project and connect to the same SAP Build Action used by the pre-created skills.
