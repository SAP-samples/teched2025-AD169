## Exercise 5 – Creation of a Joule Agent

In this exercise, you will create the **Warehouse Workforce Optimization Agent** — an intelligent Joule Agent that analyzes warehouse workloads, detects critical activity areas, and recommends or executes workforce reallocation.  

This agent brings together the Joule Skills you created earlier to enable autonomous, data-driven warehouse management.

### 💡 Understanding Joule Agents

**Joule Agents** represent the next evolution of enterprise automation — intelligent, autonomous systems that **plan, reason, and act** across multiple tools and systems to achieve complex goals.  
While **Joule Skills** execute predefined, deterministic operations, Joule Agents handle **multi-step, adaptive workflows**, deciding *what to do, when, and how* based on business context and user intent.

Functioning as orchestration layers, Joule Agents combine analytical reasoning with real-time decision-making. They use **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to interpret user requests, dynamically select relevant tools (including Joule Skills), and generate contextual responses — enabling **goal-oriented, conversational automation**.

Each Joule Agent is built around four key cognitive abilities:

1. **Planning** – The agent determines the best sequence of actions to achieve a business goal, orchestrating multiple tools or Joule Skills as needed.  
2. **Reflection** – The agent evaluates its own steps, identifies errors or missing data, and self-corrects to reach the desired outcome.  
3. **Tool Usage** – The agent dynamically invokes SAP Build Actions, Joule Skills, or other APIs to perform operations, retrieve data, or trigger systems.  
4. **Collaboration** – Agents can cooperate with other agents or human users, engaging in dialogue, confirmation, or validation when business logic requires oversight.

### ⚙️ Why This Matters

While **Joule Skills** define *what* actions can be performed (e.g., analyze workloads or simulate optimizations), the **Joule Agent** defines *how* these skills are orchestrated in a conversational, goal-driven workflow.  

This agent:
- Combines multiple Joule Skills into an intelligent flow.  
- Makes autonomous decisions based on data and context.  
- Communicates naturally with warehouse supervisors.  

In short, this is where your **Agentic Warehouse Operations** scenario becomes fully functional.

### 1. Create a New Joule Agent

1. In the **overview page** of your project, click on the dropdown **Create → Joule Agent**.  

   <img width="940" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a2e4dd5-7751-45e4-9cb1-b33d82299321" />

2. Enter the following details:  
   - **Name:** `Warehouse Workforce Optimization Agent`  
   - **Description:** `Agent to check critical workloads in the warehouse and execute optimal reassignment of workforce to activity areas.`  

> 💡 **Good to Know:**  
> Just like **Joule Skills**, the **Agent Description** plays a crucial role in how **Joule** identifies and activates the right agent during runtime.  
> A clear, business-oriented description helps Joule understand *when this agent should be called* and *for which type of user requests*.  
>  
> By describing the agent’s purpose precisely — such as “analyzing critical workloads” and “optimizing workforce allocation” — you ensure that Joule can automatically match user intents to this specific agent, improving relevance and accuracy across enterprise scenarios.

### 2. Configure the Agent Behavior

#### 🧠 Set the **Agent Expertise** Field

```You are responsible for analyzing critical activity areas in terms of workload and, if needed, simulating or optimizing workforce allocation.```

---

#### 🧭 Instructions
```
You should always start by analyzing the critical activity areas using the skill CheckingPickingWorkloadSituation.
Based on the user’s request, determine whether to perform a simulation or a real workforce optimization.
Before performing any action, ensure that all required parameters — warehouse, planning from, planning to, and planning start datetime — are provided by the user.

Pre-requisites
- Verify that all required parameters are provided.
- Ensure proper date/time formatting (UTC).
- Validate the warehouse context before executing optimization.

Available Skills:
1. Checking Picking Workload Situation
- Verifies the picking workload situation and determines workload per activity area.
- Identifies critical areas where workload > 100.
- Summarizes identified activity areas and their workloads.
- If no critical areas exist, stop further actions.

2. Simulate Workforce Optimization
- Simulates optimal workforce allocation using current context parameters.
- Summarizes rebalanced and redundant resources.
- If no results are returned, stop further actions.

3. Execute Real Workforce Optimization
- Executes real workforce allocation using context parameters.
- Summarizes rebalanced and redundant resources.
- If no results are returned, stop further actions.
- Re-check the workload situation and finalize without additional actions.
```


#### 💬 Additional Context

```
Things to Note :
- The date/time parameters PlanningFrom, PlanningTo, and PlanningStart must be converted to UTC.
- A critical activity area is one with workload greater than 100.
- In the summary, always specify the critical areas from CheckingPickingWorkloadSituation, and if simulation or execution is triggered, include the summary of rebalanced resources.
- Maintain a clear, professional, and supportive tone.
- The agent assists warehouse supervisors and shift leads in making data-driven resource allocation decisions.
- The communication style should emphasize efficiency, accountability, and collaboration.

Communication Style :
- Maintain an analytical and solution-oriented tone.
- Present insights with clear evidence and structured reasoning.
- Provide actionable and practical recommendations.
- Use structured responses for maximum clarity and readability.

### 3. Select the Agent Model

| Field | Setting |
|--------|----------|
| **Model** | `Medium` |
| **LLM Provider** | `OpenAI` |
| **Base Model** | `GPT-4o Mini` |
| **Advanced Model** | `GPT-4o` |
| **Backup LLM** | Toggle **Off** |

In **Advanced Configuration**, check the box for **Post-processing**.
> 💡 **Good to Know:**  
> The Advanced Configuration allows you to add **Pre-processing Steps** and **Post-processing Steps**. This forces the agent to decompose the steps to improve planning, reasoning and optimizes the response the agent will output.
